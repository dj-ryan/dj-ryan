I am interested in all things computer. I love everything from the low-level stuff like assembly and memory management to the high-level stuff like JavaScript and UI/X. My favorite sector would be embedded systems where the hardware and software of the system meet. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68354823/119717531-06643100-be2c-11eb-8864-b2ced4c96c17.png)

Take a look at some of my projects and contact me with any questions!
